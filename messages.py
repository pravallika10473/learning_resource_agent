        "description": "\"Can the brain do back-propagation?\" -  Geoffrey Hinton of Google & University of Toronto\n\nAbout the talk:\nDeep learning has been very successful for a variety of difficult perceptual tasks. This suggests that the sensory pathways in the brain might also be using back-propagation to ensure that lower cortical areas compute features that are useful to higher cortical areas. Neuroscientists have not taken this possibility seriously because there are so many obvious objections: Neurons do not communicate real numbers; the output of a neuron cannot represent both a feature of the world and the derivative of a cost function with respect to the neuron's output; the feedback connections to lower cortical areas that are needed to communicate error derivatives do not have the same weights as the feedforward connections; the feedback connections do not even go to the neurons from which the feedforward connections originate; there is no obvious source of labelled data. I will describe joint work with Timothy Lillicrap on ways of overcoming these objections.\n\nSupport for the Stanford Colloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series provided by the Stanford Computer Forum.\n\nSpeaker Abstract and Bio can be found here: \nhttp://ee380.stanford.edu/Abstracts/160427.html\n\nColloquium on Computer Systems Seminar Series (EE380) presents the current research in design, implementation, analysis, and use of computer systems.

In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.\n\nThis course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.\n\nhttps://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info",

Answer the question based only on the following context:

it does is it implements backpropagation now backpropagation is this algorithm that allows you to efficiently evaluate the gradient of some kind of a loss function with respect to the weights of a neural network and what that allows us to do then is we can iteratively tune the weights of that

---

a neural network and what that allows us to do then is we can iteratively tune the weights of that neural network to minimize the loss function and therefore improve the accuracy of the network so back propagation would be at the mathematical core of any modern deep neural network library like say

---

we will be able to back propagate all the way through this and back propagate into these weights of all these neurons so let's see how that works okay so let's create ourselves a very simple example data set here so this data set has four examples and so we have four possible inputs into the neural
